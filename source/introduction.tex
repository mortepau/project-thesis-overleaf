\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

Digital signal processing (DSP) is one of the fields in computer science which benefits greatly from hardware accelerators as many of the algorithms and implementations in the field have a large computational requirement.

This paper takes on the implementation of the optimal sliding DFT (oSDFT) \cite{osdft} in SystemVerilog.

The background section goes through the steps of going from the general discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) formula into the sliding DFT (sDFT) formula and then to the different parts of the oSDFT algorithm.

The oSDFT algorithm is one of the sliding window implementations that provide the lowest amount of computational requirement and the highest computational accuracy at the cost of additional memory.
